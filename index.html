    <h2>Masters Data Science Capstone Project</h2>
    <p>
    This project encapsulates all of the skills I have learned as a result of Willamette's MSDS program: Answering a research question through data wrangling, data organization, and data analytics. My project partner and I scraped Trimet data for both the schedule and usage of particular stops and routes. This data was polished, normalized, and populated into a Postgres database running on my home network. We performed statistical and machine learning analysis processes to predict usage as a result of other features. The full report can be found here: <a href="https://wu-msds-capstones.github.io/trimet-usage-data/">FULL CAPSTONE REPORT</a></p>

    <h2>Advanced Data Engineering</h2>
    <p>
    For this project, the professor simulated Prague Metro data. Students were required to take snapshots of source databases into an s3 bucket or data lake. We then organized that data from the lake into a data warehouse, using dimension and fact tables. Dimension tables include passenger information, line/station information, and specific turnstile information. We managed the turnstile schedules, accounting for any temporary overrides. We answered business questions such as "Which specific line experiences the most demand by hour and by day of the week?" and "Which passenger fare types are most common?".

    <p>
    In order to best prepare us for data engineering in industry, our professor set up a Postgres, MongoDB, and Neo4j source database, MinIO bucket, Grafana dashboard, and more on his home network for us to SSH into. Twice throughout the term, he would rotate the projects and each team would be reassigned. This required us to write documentation for our own projects and read documentation to learn the new. This was also a great experience in working on a data engineering team. Working concurrently on the same project introduced complexities and helped me realize the importance of ensuring everyone is on the same page throughout the project.</p>

    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>
    For this project, my group was tasked in creating an interactive visualization, which used R's Shiny app capability. We created a Pokemon Battle Assistant app, where you could input a pokemon and it would automatically pull up its typings and show which types would be super effective against it by highlighting certain rows and columns of a type chart. Users could also input a second pokemon to compare its stats and typings to the first. This project taught me how to use Shiny applications and was great practice for creating dynamic visualizations with R.
